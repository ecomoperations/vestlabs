	<p>Real estate should play some role in your investment portfolio, even if itâ€™s just owning your home or apartment, there are too many advantages. </p>
    
    <p>Monthly payments are going to principal - forced savings</p>
    <p>Mortage interest reduction</p>
    <p>Value increases over time - about cost of inflation</p>
    <p>Leverage</p>
    <p>Cash flow (if investment)</p>

    <p>You can leverage all of these advantages with online real estate crowdfunding sites with the added bonus of liquidity</p>

    <p>Crowdstreet</p>
    <p>Realty Mogul</p>
    <p>Realty Shares</p>
    <p>Fundrise</p>

    <p>REIT is another option but is not recommended.</p>
